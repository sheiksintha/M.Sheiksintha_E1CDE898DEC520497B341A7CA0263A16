# 2.1 Implement a class called BankAccount that represents a bank account. The class should have private attributes for account number, account holder name, and account balance. Include methods to deposit money, withdraw money, and display the account balance. Ensure that the account balance cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. Write a program to create an instance of the BankAccount class and test the deposit and withdrawal functionality.
class BankAccount:

  def __init__(self, account_number, account_holder_name, initial_balance):
    self.__account_number = account_number
    self.__account_holder_name = account_holder_name
    self.__account_balance = initial_balance

  def deposit(self, amount):
    if amount > 0:
      self.__account_balance += amount
      print(f"Deposited ${amount}. New balance: ${self.__account_balance}")
    else:
      print("Invalid deposit amount. Please enter a positive amount.")

  def withdraw(self, amount):
    if amount > 0 and amount <= self.__account_balance:
      self.__account_balance -= amount
      print(f"Withdrew ${amount}. New balance: ${self.__account_balance}")
    else:
      print("Invalid withdrawal amount or insufficient funds.")

  def display_balance(self):
    print(f"Account Number: {self.__account_number}")
    print(f"Account Holder Name: {self.__account_holder_name}")
    print(f"Account Balance: ${self.__account_balance}")


# Test the BankAccount class
if __name__ == "__main__":
  # Create an instance of BankAccount
  my_account = BankAccount("123456789", "John Doe", 1000.00)

  # Deposit and withdraw money
  my_account.deposit(500.00)
  my_account.withdraw(200.00)
  my_account.display_balance()
